# What is Hive?
Apache Hive is a Data warehouse system which is built to work on Hadoop. It is used to querying and managing large datasets residing in distributed storage. Before becoming an open source project of Apache Hadoop, Hive was originated in Facebook. It provides a mechanism to project structure onto the data in Hadoop and to query that data using a SQL-like language called HiveQL (HQL).

# Hive-Query Language(HQL)
Hive defines a simple SQL-like query language to querying and managing large datasets called Hive-QL (HQL). It’s easy to use if you’re familiar with SQL Language since they have quite similar grammar. Hive allows programmers who are familiar with the language to write the custom MapReduce framework to perform more sophisticated analysis.

- Hive provides tools to enable easy data extract/transform/load (ETL)
