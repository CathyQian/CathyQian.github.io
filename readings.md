6, [Ordinary World, by Lu Yao](https://www.amazon.com/Ordinary-World-Chinese-Lu-Yao/dp/7530211269)

    [<img align="center" src="/assets/Ordinary-World.jpg" width="200"/>](/assets/Ordinary-World.jpg)

*A good story about how to excel at the ordinary world: read and know your environment, think differently, and step out of your comfort zone.*


5, [Poor Economics: A Radical Rethinking of the Way to Fight Global Poverty, by Abhijit V. Banerjee,Esther Duflo](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10245602-poor-economics)

    [<img align="center" src="/assets/Poor-Economics.jpg" width="200"/>](/assets/Poor-Economics.jpg)

*Many years ago, my parents were living in a poor village and struggling financially at every single moment of their life. When I went to college and see how other people make a fortune by hands, I started to question my parents' struggle --- have they worked hard enough to bring us out of poverty? Now I found answers in this book: it is simply too challenging to climb out of poverty in their shoes. It requires lots of luck and wisdom, while my parents are just ordinary people without those. By the same token, it is hard to climb out of any social or financial cycles without luck and wisdom.*


4, [The Moon and Sixpence, by W. Somerset Maugham](https://www.goodreads.com/tr/book/show/44796.The_Moon_and_Sixpence)

*Living in an ordinary world, a majority of people will choose the sixpence on the ground, while few will choose the bright moon high above. It is understandable that most of us need paychecks to pay bills, making it impractical to choose the moon over the sixpence. However, we can always think big, and think long, whenever we have a choice.*

1, [Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking, by Susan Cain](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8520610-quiet?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=2w2nR4QE9V&rank=1)

    [<img align="center" src="/assets/Quiet.jpg" width="200"/>](/assets/Quiet.jpg)

*Being an introvert myself, this book has reassured me that it's totally fine to be who you are. About two thirds of the world population are introverts and introverts are having superior advantages in fields such as science, engineering and medicine where deep thinking is demanded. The main difference between introverts and extroverts are how they regain energy. Introverts rejuvenate themselves by spending time alone while extroverts achieve so by spending time with other people. In particular, introverts can be socially welcomed by listening to others in a world where everyone wants to speak but not to listen, or by thoroughly considering all aspects of an issue before offering comments and suggestions.*
