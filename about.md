I am a data scientist and machine learning engineer with over a decade of experience in various fields, including eCommerce, travel industry and optical materials R&D. I have years hands-on experience working on the full life cycle of machine learning models at scale, from business problem definition and refinement, to data wrangling and analysis, to feature engineering and model development, and model deployment and monitoring in production. 

I currently work at Expedia Group, focusing in building end-to-end machine learning models to solve travel-related problems including car rental, hotel and flight bookings.

Previously, I was a machine learning engineer building applications using deep learning models for image classification and sentimental analysis.

I completed my PhD in Chemistry from the University of Pennsylvania. My PhD thesis focused on the synthesis and investigation of plasmonic nanomaterials with enhanced optical properties. I also hold a B.S. degree in Physical Chemistry from University of Science and Technology of China.
