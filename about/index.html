        Hi, I'm Cathy. I am currently a data scientist delivering machine learning solutions at Expedia Group in the Greater Seattle Area. This webpage serves as a directory to my GitHub account where I host projects, notes, tools and thoughts about data science.

## More about me
Here is a little more about my educational background and journey towards data science especially machine learning.
I have a Ph.D. degree in Chemistry from the University of Pennsylvania, focusing in physical chemistry and applied physics. After graduating in 2014, I started to work at the University of Washington as a Washington Research Foundation Innovation Fellow. This is a highly competitive position and I was selected as one of the only three fellows among a large pool of both domestic and international candidates in 2015.

I got really interested in data science during my work at the University of Washington.By that time, I gradually realize data science especially machine learning is going to revolutionize the traditional way we analyze data and solve complicated problems in both academia and industry. One of the best articles I would suggest you to read if you have doubts on my above belief is ['Hacking Academia: Data Science and the University'](https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2014/08/22/hacking-academia/) by Jake VanderPlas, former director of the eScience Institute at the University of Washington. In fact, my research group has pioneered in adopting machine learning methods to [classify spectroscopy data collected by atomic force microscopy](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jcim.5b00722), and such work is well received in the community. As I dive deeper and deeper into the data science field, I start to have more fun and decided to make the transition into data science.

A Ph.D. degree has helped me a lot in my data science journey. What I get most out of the five years at the University of Pennsylvania is not the specific pieces of knowledge, but rather how to learn new things quickly and efficiently, how to discover new problems and solve them creatively, how to develop ownership of the projects I'm working on, how to document and present work to targeted audience, to name a few. These are all traits needed in good data scientists.

I am currently working at carrentals.com, a brand of the Expedia Group, focusing in recommender system and ranking.

## My work
I have documented my work on GitHub into the following categories:

- [Data Science Tools](https://github.com/CathyQian/DataScienceTools)
   
  This repository contains tools and templates I have gradually accumulated during work.
- [Springboard Data Science Bootcamp](https://github.com/CathyQian/Springboard_Data_Science)
  
  This repository contains most of my notes and projects in the Springboard data science bootcamp in 2017. I continue updating it after I exited the bootcamp.
- [Courses and Certificates](https://github.com/CathyQian/Courses_and_Certificates)

  This repository contains most online courses I have taken and all certificates I have earned along the way.  
- [Data Science Projects](https://github.com/CathyQian/Data_Science_Projects)
  
  This repository contains most of the independent data science projects I have done on the side.
- [Optical Simulation](https://github.com/CathyQian/Raspberry_Simulation)
  
  This repository contains simulation and modeling work I have done during my Ph.D. at the University of Pennsylvania. I publish under the name [Zhaoxia Qian](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LD8MNZoAAAAJ&hl=en).

I am interested in using artificial intelligence to solve emerging problems in healthcare, engineering, retail, insurance, ecommerce, supply chain, to name a few. Feel free to reach out to me if you share similar passion!
