## About me
Hi, I'm Cathy. This webpage contains my notes, blogs and projects in the data science journey starting from 2016.

I have a Ph.D. degree in Chemistry from the University of Pennsylvania, focusing in physical chemistry and applied physics. After graduating in 2014, I started to work at the University of Washington as a Washington Research Foundation Innovation Fellow. This is a highly competitive position and I was selected as one of the only three fellows among a large pool of both domestic and international candidates in 2015.

I got really interested in data science during my work at the University of Washington. Having nevigated the academic world for many years, I come to the realization that data science tools especially machine learning is going to revolutionize the traditional way we analyze data and solve complicated problems both inside and outside of academia. One of the best articles I would suggest you to read if you have doubts on my above belief is ['Hacking Academia: Data Science and the University'](https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2014/08/22/hacking-academia/) by Jake VanderPlas, director of the eScience Institute at the University of Washington. In fact, my research group has pioneered in adopting machine learning methods to [classify spectroscpy data collected by atomic force microscopy](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jcim.5b00722), and such work is well received in the community. As I dive deeper and deeper into the data science field, I start to have more fun and glad that I've made the right transition! 

### I have documented my work on Github into the following four categories to share with you:

- [Springboard Data Science Bootcamp](https://github.com/CathyQian/Springboard_Data_Science)
  
  This repository contains most of my notes and projects in the Springboard data science bootcamp in 2017. I keep updating it as I grow 
  as a data scientist.
  
- [Courses and Certificates](https://github.com/CathyQian/Courses_and_Certificates)
  
  This repository contains most online courses I have taken and all certificates I have earned along the way.
  
- [Data Science Projects](https://github.com/CathyQian/Data_Science_Projects)
  
  This repository contains most of the independent data science projects I have done on the side.
  
- [Raspberry Simulation](https://github.com/CathyQian/Raspberry_Simulation)
  
  This repository contains simulation and modeling work I have done during my Ph.D. at the University of Pennsylvania.

I am always eager to learn more about data science, especially machine learning and hungry to use what I have learned to solve important problems in various fields including science, engineering, retail, insurance, ecommerce, supply chain, to name a few. Feel free to reach out to me if you share similar passion!
